# Next Generation Banking Architecture (NGA)

NGA is a collaborative knowledge platform for the Modernization of Banking Systems. It is the result of years of customer engagements and contributions from IBM professional all over the world.

The NGA includes:

1. A [Point of View](/PoV.md) on how the Next Generation of Banking Architecture will be.

2. A Banking Reference Enterprise Architecture including:
  
  - [Principles](/architecture/BusinessArchitecture.md). The Architectural Principles are guidelines and rules that drive the systems design, development and management for realizing the business. 
  
  - [Business Architecture](/architecture/BusinessArchitecture.md)
  
  - Application Architecture, which provide the IT applications to support the Business Architecture. It is described through several views:
    - [Functional View](/architecture/FunctionalArchitecture.md). This view details how applications are srtructured into functional, loosely coupled components, called Domains
    - [Process View](/architecture/ProcessArchitecture.md). This section address how business processes are designed
    - [Integration View](/architecture/IntegrationArchitecture.md). This section addresses how applications are integrated to achieve a high interoperability
    - [Data View](/architecture/DataArchitecture.md). This section addresses how data is modelled, and managed
    - [Platform View](/architecture/PlatformArchitecture.md). This section describes business platforms and how they are designed and implemented
  
  - [Technology Architecture](/architecture/TechnologyArchitecture.md). Describes the technical services and infrastructure components used to design, developed, deploy, maintain, operate and manage the applications
 
3. A [Methodology](/method.md) that describes the delivery capabilities required to design and implement the next generation banking architectures. It's provided as a collection of delivery practices.

4. A Collection of Assets including reference models up to actual code

5. A Collaboration method for any IBMer to contribute to the NGA knowledge platform. The NGA is modeled following a [Metamodel](/Metamodel.md), that establishes how the architecture must be described to have a common standard for all collaborators.


The NGA is part of the ["Digital Core Systems for Banking Offering"](https://w3.ibm.com/services/contentplus/offerings/ibm-digital-core-systems-for-banking.html), providing the ley architectural constructs for the offering
