# Practice: Service Domain Design (Practice)

**Overview**

This practice describes how to design service domains following Domain Driven Design and the BIAN standard. This practice transforms business requirements into a technology-agnostic domain design that can later be implemenented using different technologies, but with the right caracteristics of modularity and integration patterns to be deployed in a hybrid multi-cloud. This practice is usually applied in Macro Design stages of Delivery phase.
