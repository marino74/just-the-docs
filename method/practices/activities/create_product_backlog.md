# Create Product Backlog


![Create Product Backlog WBS](assets/images/wbs_create_product_backlog.png)

| Task | Description |
|:--------------|:-------------------|
| **Identify Use Cases** | Create a list of use cases. Alternativelly you can use Customer Journeys, Epics and User Stories instead of use cases. <br /> The use case must be small enough to be described in an 1-hour event storming. The use cases can be incremental, one use case extending a previous one with a specific situation or requirement, so that they can be prioritized and handled for incremental delivery.|
| **Task: Prioritize Product Backlog** | Prioritize the use case in the product backlog so that they will be analyzed and designed in the most efficient order, beginning with the most simple, happy-path cases and extending it with new use cases adding complexity and exceptional situations. <br /> The use cases should have been identified incremental. Otherwise, go back to the identification of use cases. |
